# PPN

This monorepo will _eventually_ contain _everything_ needed to spin up and configure the infrastructure I use at home to self-host lots of services. 

When I say _eventually_ it's because I'm only pushing to this repository once I'm absolutely sure each "component" is safe to push - i.e. it no longer contains secrets or other sensitive values - something I'm relatively laid back about when it's only code consumed by myself, but not so laid back about when I'm pushing to a public repository!

I'm sharing it because I love this stuff, and I hope it will help others.

## What is PPN?

It stands for Price Personal Network. I wanted a short domain (as opposed to something like `jake.local` or `home.lan` that I could use for all my self-hosted services, and PPN works really well for that.

### Domain

I own the `ppn.sh` domain, and I use `int.ppn.sh` for all my LAN only services, and `ext.ppn.sh` for anything that's accessible publically.

Somewhat embarrasingly I originally registered `ppn.is` (look at that closely) because it was the first domain ending that came up as free for `ppn`. It was only a few hours later that I realised my mistake. (Replace the second `p` with an `e` and you certainly have a memorable domain name...) That's when I swiftly found and registered `ppn.sh`.

There's a lot more to come, as and when I get the time to clean up the code and document my setup.
